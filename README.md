# RIANet
The project is the official test implementation of "An End-to-End Retinex-based Illumination Attention Low-light Enhancement Network for Autonomous Driving at Night"

The training code will be published later.<br />

The training and test datasets are avaiable at [BaiduYun](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1TC7ibSNR1oeJI14X_yFt2Q).<br />
The extraced code is rn94<br />
It is noted that our model is trained on extramely low-light traffic scenes.

For testing, python infer.py <br />
For assessing, python assess_metrics.py <br />
For the complexity of model, python model_deployability.py
